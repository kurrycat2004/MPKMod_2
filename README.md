### Installation
To install MPK Mod you need to have [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net) installed. <br>
To use the Mod you have to download the file `mpkmod-X.X.X-MCX.X.jar` (for example mpkmod-2.0.0-MC1.8.9) from [releases](https://github.com/kurrycat2004/MpkMod/releases) (MPK Mod 1.x.x) or [pre-releases](https://github.com/kurrycat2004/MPKMod_2/releases) (MPK Mod 2.x.x) and put it into your `mods` folder which is located in [`.minecraft`](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft).
<br><br>
MPK Mod also supports [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) for 1.19.4.<br>
The procedure is the same as above, but **only** MPK 2 is ported to Fabric.

### Using the mod
The labels visible on screen can be fully customized inside the GUI for which you can set a keybind in controls.
Landing blocks can be set with the keybind set in controls and edited inside the landing block GUI.
